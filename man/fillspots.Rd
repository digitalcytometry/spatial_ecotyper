\title{Handle Missing Values}
\usage{
fillspots(snlist)
}
\arguments{
\item{snlist}{A list of similarity network matrices where the rows and columns correspond to spatial regions.}
}
\value{
A list of similarity network matrices with missing spatial regions filled in with zero values.
}
\description{
This function fills missing spatial regions in similarity network matrices with zeros.
It ensures that all matrices in the list have the same set of spatial regions.
}
\details{
The function first identifies all unique spatial regions across the input list of matrices.
It then ensures that each matrix has the same set of regions by adding missing regions
with zero similarity values. This step is crucial for downstream analyses that require consistent
dimensions across samples.
